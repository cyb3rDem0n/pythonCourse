"""

METHOD & FUNCTION

A function doesn't belong to any data - it gets data, it may create new data and it (generally) produces a result.

Method does all these things, but is also able to change the state of a selected entity.
A method is owned by the data it works for, while a function is owned by the whole code.

A typical function invocation looks as follows: result = function(arg),
while a typical method invocation looks like this:result = data.method(arg).
